## 📖 About The Project
This portfolio is not just a static collection of HTML files. It is a fully interactive Single Page Application (SPA) concept designed to solve problems and visualize data.

At 12 years old, my goal was to move beyond simple "coding tutorials" and build a platform that integrates **data structures**, **external APIs**, and **real-world logic**.

### Key Features:
* **📊 Algorithm Visualizer:** An interactive demonstration of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm to visualize O(n²) time complexity.
* **📡 API Integration:** Consumes the `Quotable.io` REST API to fetch real-time data using `async/await` patterns.
* **📉 Data Visualization:** Implements **Chart.js** to render a radar chart of my technical skill set dynamically.
* **📍 Maryvale Tech Map:** A filtering algorithm designed to help students in my zip code (85019) find free Wi-Fi and study resources.
* **💻 Hacker Mode:** A hidden CLI (Command Line Interface) easter egg triggered by the `~` key.

## 🧩 Code Highlights

### 1. Algorithm Visualization Logic
I implemented a sorting visualizer to understand how computers process data.
```javascript
async function bubbleSort() {
    // Nested loops for O(n^2) complexity
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < len - i - 1; j++) {
            // Visual swapping logic...
        }
    }
}
